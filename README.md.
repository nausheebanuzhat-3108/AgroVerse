Project Summary – AgroVerse: AI-Powered Smart Farming Assistant with Digital Twin
💡 Overview
AgroVerse is an AI-powered smart farming assistant designed to help farmers make data-driven decisions for better crop yield, reduced costs, and sustainable farming.
It combines AI, IoT, 3D visualization, and voice assistance into a single platform that’s simple, affordable, and accessible — even in rural areas with limited internet.
🚜 Core Features
AI Crop Doctor 🤖 – Detects crop diseases from leaf images and gives instant solutions.
IoT Sensor Monitoring 🌡️ – Tracks soil moisture, pH, temperature, and sends smart alerts.
3D Digital Twin Farm 🧠 – A virtual replica of the farm showing real-time soil and crop health.
My Farm 📍 – Farmers can save their farm details like crop type, area, soil data, and last irrigation date.
Chatbot & Voice Assistant 🎤 – Responds in local languages (text + speech) for ease of use.
Recommendations Page 🌱 – AI suggests fertilizer, irrigation, and pest control tips based on real-time data.
Offline Support – Works even with low or no internet, syncing when back online.
Secure Login 🔐 – Farmers log in using their phone number (OTP-based).
